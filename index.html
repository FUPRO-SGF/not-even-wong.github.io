<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm a physicist, musician, and educator by training, and I enjoy seeing numbers jump through hoops. I'll be updating my personal research projects here as time goes by.</p>
        <p>My personal interests lie in the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Finding patterns in data</li>
        <li>Text analysis and natural language processing</li>
        <li>Understanding the role of human cognition in learning and understanding</li>
        <li>Analysis of various artistic and creative endeavours through an interdisciplinary lens</li>
        </ul>
