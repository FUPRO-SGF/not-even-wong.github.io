I am a strong proponent of making use of personal technology for teaching. Students of this era have grown up with ubiquitous smart devices, which they use to engage with the world around them. When everyone in the room has such powerful technology in their pockets, it would be a waste to not use it to its full potential. Furthermore, I believe that it's important to recognise how digital literacy has changed so much between generations in just a decade, and classroom content can be so much more relevant when translated and communicated in familiar ways to become part of life.

These are some of the methods I've experimented with over the past few years:

<b><u>Anonymous lecture engagement system</u></b>

Video tech - slow motion, sharing and saving

Online collaboration

Data analytics in the classroom

Instagram engagement
