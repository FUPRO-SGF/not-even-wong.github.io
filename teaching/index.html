<p>I am a strong proponent of making use of personal technology for teaching. Students of this era have grown up with ubiquitous smart devices, which they use to engage with the world around them. When everyone in the room has such powerful technology in their pockets, it would be a waste to not use it to its full potential. Furthermore, I believe that it's important to recognise how digital literacy has changed so much between generations in just a decade, and classroom content can be so much more relevant when translated and communicated in familiar ways to become part of life.</p>

<p>These are some of the methods I've experimented with over the past few years:</p>

  <p><b><u>Anonymous lecture engagement system</u></b><a name="1"></a> </p>

<p>Common knowledge states that lectures are by nature problematic because they are top-down didactic methods of teaching. On the other hand, lectures are very convenient because they allow one teacher to transmit information to a large number of students simultaneously. </p>

<p>I believe that lectures don't have to be a strictly one-way channel. For example, many lecturers and presenters have made use of tools such as mentimeter to get responses from their audience. However, while I agree that these methods are useful, they are still lecturer-initiated and lecturer-controlled, as compared to an active classroom where students can voice up any time if they choose to do so.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the majority of students are unwilling to voice their concerns during lecture for several reasons. This can occur for a wide range of reasons: social anxiety, not wanting to delay the lecturer, not wanting to appear wrong in public, and so on.</p>

<p>To avoid these problems, for several years now, I've been using an anonymous online question and feedback system for my lectures. This takes the form of a simple Google Form that students can access on their smartphone anytime. The URL to the form is on every lecture slide, and bundled together with a QR code on the first page of the lecture notes:</p>

<p>Any incoming messages goes to a Google Sheet:</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-even-wong/not-even-wong.github.io/master/teaching/lecture%20system%20replies.jpg">

<p>While lecturing, I have two laptops open: one for slides, and one for me to see any incoming questions. I've been planning my lecture pacing around this system, making sure it's flexible enough for me to allocate time for up to a certain number of questions.</p>

<p>I've found this system to be incredibly useful. Students have used these to actively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let me know when I'm going too fast and they need more time to understand certain parts of the lecture</li>
  <li>Asked questions or requested clarification</li>
  <li>Let me know about mistakes in the slides - I've even started giving out small chocolates to any student who spots errors</li>
  <li>Asked me (irrelevant) personal questions that I usually don't address directly unless there's extra time and it's not inappropriate - most students wouldn't dare to ask and find out more about their teachers if it's not anonymous
</ul>

<p>The first two points are really important! It helps me to gauge how well the cohort seems to be absorbing the material. Sometimes things that I think would be too complex turn out to go smoothly, and more often, things that I think are easy end up taking longer than expected. In addition, through the questions that pop up, a lot of misconceptions or gaps that wouldn't have occured to me show up.</p>

<p>Having the questions come in through an anonymous online form lets students continuously ask their questions freely, but I can choose appropriate points in the lecture (usually between slides) to pause and address them. I've also come to find that it seems to help students build confidence. This is something that I feel every lecturer should try at least once.</p>

<p><b><u>Smartphones as a media and data collection tool</u></b><a name="2"></a> </p>

<p>I highly encourage my students to take photos and videos during class. This is something that isn't just limited to the younger generation - almost everyone I know of would use their phone to save important or interesting information. I want the materials covered in class to be something that students can engage with repeatedly in a manner familiar to them. This is especially true for demonstrations - usually, if I were to bring an interesting demonstration to class, the students will only be able to experience it once. However, if it has been recorded on video from more than one angle, and subsequently shared, it becomes a reference that can be watched repeatedly. I'm especially happy if it gets memed, since that probably means it'll have more lasting power.</p>

<p>Most importantly, smartphones can take this a step further. Almost all newer smartphones come with slow motion video technology - and therefore, demonstrations that occur too fast can now be slowed down smoothly, and watched or rewound repeatedly and analysed frame by frame. This can increase the number of possible demonstrations that can be done in class! I'm looking forward to the day where smartphones come with built-in microscopes.</p>

<p><b><u>Online collaboration</u></b><a name="3"></a> </p>

<p>Google Suite has made a huge difference to my life - the release of Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, and so on has made group collaboration so much easier. Now, with smartphones in every pocket, students can collate data and work together on documents that I can see updated in real time.</p>

<p>For example, one thing that I do every year is to get students to work in groups for lab experiments, and bring in some device that works well with Google Sheets (tablet, laptop, etc.). For this class, they all key in their data into a huge shared Google Sheet, which I can use to monitor their progress as the class goes on. By the end of the class, the data in the sheet for analysis - comparing and contrasting between the results from different groups.</p>

<p><b><u>Data analytics in the classroom</u></b><a name="4"></a> </p>

<p>Inspired by propriety tools such as Learning Catalytics, I wanted to try this approach in my classroom, making use of the tools freely available to me. In the end, I opted for using Google Forms with printed worksheets.</p>

<p>This is the workflow for the session:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Students work individually on the multiple choice questions in the worksheet, and submit their answers through Google forms</li>
  <li>Using the data, I shuffle them into groups that maximise diversity of answers within each group</li>
  <li>Students then discuss their answers in the group, and come to a final consensus, which they then submit through Google forms</li>
</ol>

<p>I've only had the opportunity to use these a few times, but the results were excellent. I paired the questions with self-reported confidence ratings for two-tiered MCQ questions. While the results from individual work were often quite diverse across both answers and confidence ratings, through group discussion, the vast majority of groups came to the correct answer with high confidence. Throughout the activity, I did almost no direct teaching - the students mostly worked out the answers on their own.</p>

<p>This is another activity that I would strongly recommend whever it can be relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/not-even-wong/not-even-wong.github.io/blob/master/teaching/analytics_sorter.py" target="_blank">Here is some sample code for an algorithm that should quickly arrange students into diverse groups based on their results</a></p>

<p><b><u>Instagram engagement</u></b><a name="5"></a> </p>

<p>Finally, this is something that I've been trying earlier this year. I believe Instagram is a great tool for reaching out to students. Right now, Instagram is one of the primary mediums through which youths engage with the world (and so do I, so it's possible that I can still be considered young).</p>

<p>A key feature of Instagram is the use of "Instagram Stories". These are short posts that disappear within 24 hours (unless you add it to your "Highlights"). These have the option to allow for users to add questions, voting, or other means of engagement overlaid on top of the post's photo or video.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I tried to extend the demos I do for my class to a more general audience (the rest of the cohort). I uploaded videos of the demo as an Instastory, ending before the punchline and with a question attached. A few days later, I'd upload the rest of the video with an extremely short explanation. One aspect of this format that is simultaneously a strength and weakness is that the content of the Instastory has to be extremely short.</p>

<p>This is an example of a question and answer:</p>

<p>Experimenting with this was quite fun, but also extremely time consuming. If I do this again in future when I get back to teaching, I'd want to plan further in advance and stockpile a collection of pre-made videos and questions. However, I suspect that by then, social media will have moved on and I'll need to learn a new cultural literacy.</p>
